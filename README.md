# PineCast

A podcast app for linux phones
Made with c++ has very basic functionality such as itunes search, and a rudimentry Library system.
this is my first serious application built for Linux so if you see some odd design choices (bad code) that's my inexperience at work.
*when compiling for actual usage use ./compile.sh 1 for and optimized build*
